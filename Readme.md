# WPF Logger

This repository contains the finished project for [Log window from scratch](http://coding-scars.com/log-window-0/), over at my blog.  
I wanted to release the code for each blog post separately, but never got the chance.  
It's probably useful for someone, so here it is! :raised_hands:

![Logger example](https://github.com/MetanoKid/logger-wpf/blob/master/Docs/images/Logger.gif)

## :heavy_check_mark: What's included?

- All of the source code to make it work.
- Project structure.
- C++ to C# interoperability.
- Example Visual Studio 2022 solution that puts it all together.
  - Ready to open an run.

## :warning: What this isn't

- Production ready performance.
- Thread safety.
- Intellisense-proof.
